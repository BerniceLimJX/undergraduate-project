# Final Year Project

Undergraduate projects are typically research-oriented projects that are undertaken by undergraduate students in their final year of study. These projects provide an opportunity for students to apply the knowledge and skills they have acquired throughout their undergraduate studies to a real-world problem or research question. The projects can vary in scope and complexity, depending on the requirements of the program and the specific topic chosen by the student. Some projects may involve a literature review, data collection, data analysis, or the development of a software application.

Typically, students will work closely with a faculty advisor or mentor who will guide them through the research process, provide feedback and support, and help them to develop their skills in critical thinking, problem-solving, and communication. The final product of an undergraduate project may take the form of a research paper, a software application, a prototype, or a presentation. The project is usually assessed based on the quality of the research or product, as well as the student's ability to communicate their findings or project outcomes effectively.

Overall, undergraduate projects provide an excellent opportunity for students to apply their knowledge and skills in a practical and meaningful way, and to develop important skills that will serve them well in their future careers or further studies.
