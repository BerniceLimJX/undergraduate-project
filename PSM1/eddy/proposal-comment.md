# Problem Background and Proposed Solution
The preservation of cultural heritage sites is an essential task that requires ongoing attention and care. Unfortunately, many heritage sites suffer from a lack of proper maintenance, which can lead to their gradual deterioration over time. In the past, traditional methods of maintenance were often reactive, meaning that significant damage had already occurred before any action was taken.

To address this issue, there is a need for more proactive measures that can detect potential issues and suggest preventive maintenance actions to preserve the site's aesthetics and cultural values. This is where the proposed research comes in.

The research aims to develop a dashboard that collects and displays microclimate parameters of heritage sites. The data collected will be analyzed using machine learning algorithms to suggest appropriate preventive maintenance actions for the heritage sites identified by the local authority of Johor Bahru. This approach will allow for early detection of potential issues and the implementation of appropriate maintenance measures before significant damage occurs.

The proposed dashboard has the potential to revolutionize the way cultural heritage sites are maintained and preserved. By providing real-time data on the microclimate of heritage sites, the dashboard can help identify potential issues and suggest preventive measures to maintain the site's aesthetics and cultural values. This proactive approach to maintenance could help ensure the preservation of cultural heritage sites for future generations to enjoy.
