# Problem Background and Proposed Solution
The preservation of cultural heritage sites is a crucial task, and the lack of proper maintenance often leads to their gradual deterioration. Traditional methods of maintenance are often reactive, resulting in significant damage to the site before any action is taken. Therefore, there is a need for proactive measures that can detect potential issues and suggest preventive maintenance actions to preserve the site's aesthetics and cultural values. This research aims to address this problem by developing a dashboard that collects and displays microclimate parameters using machine learning algorithms to suggest appropriate preventive maintenance actions for the heritage site identified by the local authority of Johor Bahru.
