# Problem Background and Proposed Solution
The preservation of cultural heritage sites is a significant challenge that requires constant attention and care. Unfortunately, due to the lack of proper maintenance, many heritage sites suffer from gradual deterioration. The traditional methods of maintenance often used in the past were reactive, meaning that significant damage had already occurred before any action was taken. This reactive approach has resulted in many heritage sites being lost forever.

To address this problem, proactive measures are needed to detect potential issues and suggest preventive maintenance actions to preserve the site's aesthetics and cultural values. In this research proposal, we aim to preserve heritage architecture in Johor Bahru, Malaysia, by leveraging machine learning-based microclimate monitoring.

Our proposed solution involves collecting microclimate data from the Malaysian Meteorological Department, analyzing it using appropriate machine learning algorithms, and developing a preventive maintenance strategy based on the insights gained. We will also design a user-friendly dashboard that displays real-time microclimate data and recommends appropriate maintenance actions. The developed model and dashboard will be evaluated and tested to ensure effectiveness in assisting local authorities with heritage site preservation.

Our approach has the potential to be adapted and applied to other heritage sites in Malaysia and beyond. By contributing to the broader goal of safeguarding cultural heritage sites for future generations, our research will help to ensure that these important sites are preserved and appreciated for years to come.
