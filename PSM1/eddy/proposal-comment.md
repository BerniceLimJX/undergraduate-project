# Problem Background and Proposed Solution
The preservation of cultural heritage sites is a significant challenge that requires constant attention and care. Unfortunately, due to the lack of proper maintenance, many heritage sites suffer from gradual deterioration. The traditional methods of maintenance often used in the past were reactive, meaning that significant damage had already occurred before any action was taken. This reactive approach has resulted in many heritage sites being lost forever.

To address this problem, proactive measures are needed to detect potential issues and suggest preventive maintenance actions to preserve the site's aesthetics and cultural values. In this research proposal, we aim to preserve heritage architecture in Johor Bahru, Malaysia, by leveraging machine learning-based microclimate monitoring.

Our proposed solution involves collecting microclimate data from the Malaysian Meteorological Department, analyzing it using appropriate machine learning algorithms, and developing a preventive maintenance strategy based on the insights gained. We will also design a user-friendly dashboard that displays real-time microclimate data and recommends appropriate maintenance actions. The developed model and dashboard will be evaluated and tested to ensure effectiveness in assisting local authorities with heritage site preservation.

Our approach has the potential to be adapted and applied to other heritage sites in Malaysia and beyond. By contributing to the broader goal of safeguarding cultural heritage sites for future generations, our research will help to ensure that these important sites are preserved and appreciated for years to come.

## Step-by-step
Here is a step-by-step approach for solving the problem of preserving cultural heritage sites using machine learning-based microclimate monitoring:

1. Define the scope of the project: Clearly define the objectives and goals of the project, identify the specific heritage site or sites to be monitored, and determine the microclimate parameters to be monitored.

2. Collect microclimate data: Gather microclimate data from various sources, such as weather stations, sensors, and satellite imagery. Clean and preprocess the data to ensure accuracy and consistency.

3. Analyze the data: Use suitable machine learning algorithms to analyze the microclimate data and identify potential issues that could lead to deterioration of the heritage site. Develop models to predict future trends and identify the most significant factors that affect the site's preservation.

4. Develop a preventive maintenance strategy: Based on the insights gained from the data analysis, develop a preventive maintenance strategy that suggests appropriate actions to preserve the site's aesthetics and cultural values. This strategy could include recommendations for regular cleaning, repairs, and renovations, as well as guidelines for managing the site's microclimate.

5. Design a user-friendly dashboard: Develop a user-friendly dashboard that displays real-time microclimate data and provides recommendations for maintenance actions. Ensure that the dashboard is easy to use, visually appealing, and has all the necessary features to help local authorities make informed decisions about heritage site preservation.

6. Test and evaluate the system: Test the developed system and evaluate its effectiveness in assisting local authorities with heritage site preservation. Make any necessary adjustments to the system to improve its performance and usability.

7. Implement the system: Once the system has been tested and evaluated, implement it in the heritage site identified by the local authority of Johor Bahru. Train the staff on how to use the system and provide ongoing support and maintenance.

8. Scale the system: Consider scaling the system to other heritage sites in Malaysia and beyond, adapting it as necessary to suit different environments and cultural contexts.

By following these steps, it is possible to develop an effective system for preserving cultural heritage sites using machine learning-based microclimate monitoring. This approach is proactive and can help to prevent significant damage to heritage sites before it is too late, ensuring that they are preserved for future generations.

## Three possible objectives for the project:

Develop a machine learning-based system to monitor microclimate parameters and identify potential issues that could lead to the deterioration of heritage sites.

Design a preventive maintenance strategy based on the insights gained from the microclimate data analysis, which suggests appropriate maintenance actions to preserve the site's aesthetics and cultural values.

Create a user-friendly dashboard that displays real-time microclimate data and provides recommendations for maintenance actions to assist local authorities with heritage site preservation.

## Machine learning algorithms

There are several machine learning algorithms that could be used to analyze the microclimate data and identify potential issues that could lead to the deterioration of heritage sites. Here are three possible algorithms that could be used:

1. Decision Trees: Decision Trees are a popular machine learning algorithm for classification and regression tasks. In the context of heritage site preservation, Decision Trees could be used to analyze the microclimate data and identify the most significant factors that affect the site's preservation. Based on these factors, the algorithm could suggest appropriate maintenance actions to preserve the site's aesthetics and cultural values.

2. Random Forest: Random Forest is an ensemble learning algorithm that combines multiple Decision Trees to improve prediction accuracy and reduce the risk of overfitting. Random Forest could be used to analyze the microclimate data and develop a predictive model that identifies potential issues that could lead to the deterioration of heritage sites. Based on this model, the algorithm could suggest appropriate preventive maintenance actions to preserve the site's aesthetics and cultural values.

3. Support Vector Machines (SVM): SVM is a popular machine learning algorithm for classification and regression tasks. SVM could be used to analyze the microclimate data and identify the most significant factors that affect the site's preservation. Based on these factors, the algorithm could suggest appropriate preventive maintenance actions to preserve the site's aesthetics and cultural values.

Overall, the choice of algorithm depends on various factors such as data characteristics, problem complexity, and the type of predictive model required. It is essential to choose the algorithm that best suits the specific requirements of the project to achieve the desired results.
